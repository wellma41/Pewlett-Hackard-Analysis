# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

This project produced four tables that can be broken up into two groups.
First, three tables detailing the name and title of impending retirees and a count of each position that is retiring.
Second, a table that provides a list of employees that are eligible for participation in a mentorship program to help replace the aging workforce.

## Results

### Retirees
	
-There are 90339 individuals close to retirement.

- Over 40000 employees either switched titles or were promoted.

-Most of the retiring empolyees are senior level staff and engineers so management will probably have to promote a number of the junior staff to fill the upper ranks.
	
### Mentorship

-There are 1550 employees eligible for the mentorship program


## Summary

 - Assuming that Pewlett Hackard wants to maintain a similar headcount going forward they will have to fill over 90,000 roles in the coming years. It would be adviseable to initially focus on promotion to lessen the burden of the mentorship program.

- Under the provided guidelines the mentorship program is currently not borad enough to train newly promoted or hired personel. I recommend expanding the parameters for eligibility.
